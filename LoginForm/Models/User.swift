               Johnny Silverhand, born Robert John Linder, was a famous influential rockerboy and the lead singer of the band Samurai before its breakup in 2008. A military veteran who defined the rockerboy movement to what it is today, he was the most prominent figure that fought against the corrupted NUSA government and megacorporations, often being described as a terrorist. Despite being charismatic and quite the charmer Johnny is also known to be irrational, impulsive, and a manipulator.
               
               Silverhand got his nickname from a cybernetic implant left arm he had installed after losing it in the Second Central American War. One of the early (and most probable) victims of cyberpsychosis, he then became very temperamental and \"on the edge\". He was described as driven by \"dedication and ambitions, but at the end of the day he doesn't care much for the people around him as long as they are used to accomplish his goals\" in one interview.
